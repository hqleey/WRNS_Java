# Unit Deliverable 3 - Final Project

> This code is based off the game **We Are Not Really Strangers**
> I play this game alot with my family/friends to build connections that don't always come up with daily conversations. It was getting tiresome bringing this Red Box of cards everywhere, So I thought I'd recreate it as my Unit Deliverable.

# What got Modified
My original idea was something that was changed multiple times. After working with fileInput and fileOutput labs, I knew this would be beneficial to my lab. The file information was going to help, as someone using this lab only has to upload new csv files, rather than updating the code and adding the questions to an array, which can be very tedious. 

I also originally wanted both a Input and Output portion of my UD which saved the answer presented in Wildcard, where a file would be updated based on the answer. I wanted the file to initially have WildCard question, and when the user answers, it would update the line by adding the answer they provided to the respective quetion. Although this was my original idea, I realized it would be creating unneccesary work, as the answer deosn't have much meaning in my code. It doesn't get manipulated later on in the game, or referenced to, so I only used the answer data provided in the historyText portion of my lab. 

I also had trouble as I kept using Arrays intially in my UD, this was difficult to deal with as Arrays have fixed lengths, and if a user wanted to have more questions in the csv file, I wouldn't want to resrict them to a certain amount of questions. I started using ArrayLists, and it was helpful without a fixed length. 

Front-End
I found it difficult initially, as I felt I was trying to stick to an original idea. Yet with more information, I realized there were more components that would be better for my code as a whole. ComboBox and BorderPane were especially useful. I still feel I could have made the formatting a little better with more allignment and restrictions on users. I also feel I should have added a play again option for the user, and a randomizer for the cards provided.
